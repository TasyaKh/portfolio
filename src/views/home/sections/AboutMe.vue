        Hello, i am currently on my way to the world of web-development.
        It all started back in 2020, when I suddenly decided to become a programmer,
        but at that time I still did not know which field to choose and wrote in
        different programming languages.
    </p>

    <p>
        But already today I am deeply immersed in web development and exploring its diverse
        and interesting world! I really enjoy studying various frontend frameworks
        and development approaches, creating client-server applications, and I intend
        to continue in the same spirit and grow in this industry!
